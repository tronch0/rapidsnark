# Benchmark Tests

This folder contains a series of benchmark tests designed to evaluate the performance of rapidsnark prover with commonly circuits implementations.

## Overview

The benchmark tests cover the most common circuit implementations, aiming to provide insight into the performance and cost of widely-used circuits. By offering a comprehensive set of benchmarking tests, we aim to gain better understanding of the current performance levels of rapidsnark.

## Getting Started

Before running the benchmark tests, ensure that you have followed the instructions in the main `README.md` file to set up the rapidsnark environment. Make sure you have the prover executable in the `build`/`build_prover` folder.

A valid environment to run the benchmark tests contains the following:
 - prover executable in the `build`/`build_prover` folder
 - Clone circomlib by running the script [benchmark/common/setup_circomlib.sh](./common/setup_circomlib.sh)


## Running the Benchmark Tests

1. [Poseidon](./poseidon) - Assess Poseidon hash function performance.
2. [SHA256](./sha256) - Evaluate SHA256 hashing efficiency.
3. [Merkle tree inclusion](./merkletree) - Test Merkle tree inclusion proof.

To run a specific benchmark test, run the `run_benchmark.sh` with the following arguments:
- <strong>Benchmark name</strong> - choose the test to run by specify the folder name of the test (e.g for merkle tree inclusion, use `merkletree`)
 - <strong>Input Parameters file</strong> - Choose the input file you wish to use in the benchmark (need to pass the postfix after `input_` of the filename).
 - <strong>Degree of ptau file</strong> - Specify the degree of the needed patu (will be downloaded if not exist).

### Example
Say we want to run a benchmark on merkle tree inclusion proof for a tree with height of 30, we will need to run the following command `./run_benchmark.sh merkletree 30 20`.
